I've been meaning to mess around with [React.js](http://facebook.github.io/react/), Facebook's javascript library for building user interfaces. React is the first of its kind to do something completely unique when it handles rendering updates to the DOM. There are many [frameworks](http://angularjs.org/) and [libraries](http://knockoutjs.com/) devoted to doing this exact thing, with more or less other stuff going on to round out MV* architectures.
