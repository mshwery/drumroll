There's been some recent [discussion](http://branch.com/b/redesigning-the-save-symbol-let-s-do-this) on redesigning the save icon. This conversation crops up from [time](http://www.ironicsans.com/2011/04/idea_a_new_save_icon.html) to [time](http://www.marco.org/2011/04/05/replacing-the-save-icon), but no lasting fruit has come from it... <i>yet</i>.

I feel the "save" metaphor is old, but often still relevant. Ever make changes that you don't want auto-saved? I do. I make a series of changes when working through an idea, and then decide if I want to keep or reject them.

Perhaps the word 'save' needs some thought. What other words represent both legacy, modern, and future versions of this action? Keep, commit, update, sync. 

I really like 'commit' as one who works with versioning systems on a daily basis. A file goes through many changes â€“ some being committed, others discarded. Each commit is a snapshot of the file in that moment. Here's my first attempt:

<figure><img src="../img/commit.png"/></figure>

I think there's a lot of room to move this idea further. Perhaps something less abstract, or actually more indexical is necessary. Maybe we don't need an iconographic representation at all?
