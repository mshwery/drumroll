At last! I launched my simple list app, [minimaList](http://getminimalist.com). You can follow the app or ask questions on twitter: [@get_minimalist](http://twitter.com/get_minimalist)

I primarily made it as an exercise in building a Rails API consumed by client-side Backbone.js. I had some more requirements – like it should be device-independent; simply designed; and limited, yet focused functionality.
