title: I Just Launched Minimalist!
---
## At last! I launched my simple list app, [minimaList](http://getminimalist.com). You can follow the app or ask questions on twitter: [@get_minimalist](http://twitter.com/get_minimalist)

In early 2012, I started developing minimaList for my wife and I. We needed a simple way to share lists without the hassle or formality of user accounts. I had been itching to get familiar with Backbone.js and use some Rails skills. Today I launched the app. So go, make some lists!
